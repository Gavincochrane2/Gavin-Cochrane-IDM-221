            The 6 designs are drawn by hand and inspired by the 3 pictures at the bottom,
        I then put them into photoshop to edit the background and combine it with a foreground design that is an abstraction of my initals

                I created a notan out of black paper on a white background and then focused in on one part to create a pattern from. 
            I then filled the pattern with shades of grey and translated it onto the album cover shown in the top left

        We took portraits that resembled a still from a movie we watched (shown in bottom middle). 
        I then created 2 value scales (one by hand and the other with pieces of a magazine) and translated them onto the portrait of myself according to the value of each section
