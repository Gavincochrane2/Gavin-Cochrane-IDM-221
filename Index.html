    <h1>Gavin's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>I am a second year user experience and interaction design major at Drexel university</p>

    <a href="images/cochrane_g_108_p1_expressive_line_critique_template_stockton-copy">Expressive line Project</a>
        <p>The 6 designs are drawn by hand and inspired by the 3 pictures at the bottom,
        I then put them into photoshop to edit the background and combine it with a foreground design that is an abstraction of my initals</p>

            <a href="images/cochrane_g108_p2_shape_pattern_critique_template_stockton-copy.webp">Shape and Pattern Project</a>
            <p>I created a notan out of black paper on a white background and then focused in on one part to create a pattern from. 
            I then filled the pattern with shades of grey and translated it onto the album cover shown in the top left</p>

    <a href="images/cochrane_g_108_p3_value_critique_final_template_150-copy.webp">Value Project</a>    
    <p>We took portraits that resembled a still from a movie we watched (shown in bottom middle). 
        I then created 2 value scales (one by hand and the other with pieces of a magazine) and translated them onto the portrait of myself according to the value of each section</p>
